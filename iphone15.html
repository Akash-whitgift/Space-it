      <p>The iPhone 15 Pro retains the same sleek and sophisticated design as the iPhone 14 Pro, with its flat edges and glass back. However, there are a few subtle changes worth noting. The titanium frame is now slightly thinner, making the phone even more lightweight. And the rear camera module is now larger, to accommodate the new 48MP sensor.</p>
